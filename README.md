# CourseConnect is a web-based application that generates random lettered codes for registered schools/teachers, allowing registered students to vote/comment on material/content for the teacher. These codes allow the teachers and students to communicate using forms which allow teachers to ask questions about certain problems with the ability for students to also answer back.
